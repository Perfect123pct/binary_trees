25. BST - Insert
#advanced

Write a function that inserts a value in a Binary Search Tree

    Prototype: bst_t *bst_insert(bst_t **tree, int value);
    Where tree is a double pointer to the root node of the BST to insert the value
    And value is the value to store in the node to be inserted
    Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure
    If the address stored in tree is NULL, the created node must become the root node.
    If the value is already present in the tree, it must be ignored

Your file 0-binary_tree_node.c will be compile during the correction
